what about different backed up DBs??
What about stripes???

NOTES: 
- There will be one overlap between files reported as kept in the weekly and monthly pots. Unless one of the relevant setting is set to 0, one monthly file / set of striped files also belongs to the weekly set. This is normal and not a concern.
- When dealing with striped files, in the monthly set, the overlapping set with the weekly set will only contain one file from the set, not the others, which are however listed in the "weekly" list. This is because of how the algorithm works and should cause no concerns.
